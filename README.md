# Surfs_Up

## Project Overview

In this report we will present an investment proposal per our main investors request. We obtained data of the weather trends in Oahu, Hawaii. With these results we can back a strong business plan for a potential business. The concept behind this business is to open-up a Surf & Shake shop that serves surfboards and ice cream to locals, and tourists.
With the use of SQLAlchemy, SQLite, PostgreSQL databases and Python notebooks we will demonstrate how to efficiently launch a successful shop. 

## Results

With the data from nine different stations we can have a better understanding of what the weather patterns are in this region. The weather is a crucial factor for the success of this business venture. What comes after the processes of extracting, transforming and loading the new data is that we can make better predictions for this investment that could answer the following questions:


   * What are the ranges in temperature for this particular city in Hawaii?
   * What are the annual rainfall patterns?
   * What kind of impact can we predict based on precipitation and weather for our business              venture?
   
With the information shown below, we can note that the average temperature for the month of June is 74.9 degrees, with a maximum temperature of 85 degrees. As expected, summer time is a profitable time for our shop with temperatures like this being an attraction for tourists to come visit and surf in Oahu. Not only that, but also a great opportunity to provide ice cream for our clientele while they prepare and or buy their gear at our shop. 
Furthermore, December temperatures show an average of 71.04 degrees with a high of 83 degrees; which is not a big difference with the temperatures of the month of June. We can rule out the temperatures of the two different seasons as factors that may negatively affect the consumption of our products.

While this is true to the temperature, in Oahu there is a rainy season and dry season. This is where we need to answer our second question. What is the data for the precipitation for the month of June and December?
Below we will show the summary statistics for the precipitation data for both June and December for as long as nine different seasons from our dataset source.

Precipitation is always expressed as a percentage of the total time in the reporting period (day-long). From the data we retrieved, we compared the average precipitation for the month of June, made into a percentage of 13.63% meaning that in June, the average time of rainfall is 3.27 hours a day. While in December the average is 21.68% meaning that the average duration of rainfall in December is 5.20 hours a day. 

## Conclusion

Our goal is to provide W.Avy (potential investor) with insight into the weather patterns where we would like to build the shop, and visualize the trends of the weather. With the previous results we can make the assessment that this would be a good investment for a business venture. Although there is rainfall, the temperature levels remain in the warm numbers and this is why Hawaii is such a tourist attraction. We can profit from a business idea that welcomes the entire family and although these factors could change we have enough evidence to move further into investigating more factors and making a sound business decision.
